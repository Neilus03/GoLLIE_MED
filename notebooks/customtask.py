# # Custom Tasks with GoLLIE
# 
# This notebook is an example of how to run Custom Tasks with GoLLIE. This notebook covers:
# 
# - How to define the guidelines for a task
# - How to load GoLLIE
# - How to generate model inputs
# - How to parse the output
# - How to implement a scorer and evaluate the output
# 
# You can modify this notebook to run any task task you want

# ### Import requeriments
# 
# See the requeriments.txt file in the main directory to install the required dependencies

sys.path.append("../") # Add the GoLLIE base directory to sys path

# ## Load GoLLIE
# 
# We will load GOLLIE-7B from the huggingface-hub.
# You can use the function AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained if you prefer it. However, we provide a handy load_model function with many functionalities already implemented that will assist you in reproducing our results.
# 
# Please note that setting use_flash_attention=True is mandatory. Our flash attention implementation has small numerical differences compared to the attention implementation in Huggingface. Using use_flash_attention=False will result in the model producing inferior results. Flash attention requires an available CUDA GPU. Running GOLLIE pre-trained models on a CPU is not supported. We plan to address this in future releases.
# 
# - Set force_auto_device_map=True to automatically load the model on available GPUs.
# - Set quantization=4 if the model doesn't fit in your GPU memory.

# %%
model, tokenizer = load_model(
    inference=True,
    model_weights_name_or_path="HiTZ/GoLLIE-7B",

# ## Define the guidelines
# 
# First, we will define the labels and guidelines for the task. We will represent them as Python classes.
# 
# The following guidelines have been defined for this example. They were not part of the pre-training dataset. Therefore, we will run GOLLIE in zero-shot settings using unseen labels.
# 
# We will use the `Generic` class, which is a versatile class that allows for the implementation of any task you want. However, since the model has never seen the Generic label during training, we will rename it to Template, which is recognized by the model (as it was used in the Tacred dataset).
# 
# We will define two classes: `Launcher` and `Mission`. Each class will have a definition and a set of slots that the model needs to fill. Each slot also requires a type definition and a short description, which can include examples. For instance, for the `Launcher` class, we define three slots:
# 
# - The `mention`, which will be the name of the Launcher vehicle and should be a string.
# - The `space_company` that operated the vehicle, which will also be a string.
# - The `crew`, which is defined as a list of astronauts. Therefore, GoLLIE will fill this slot with a list of strings.
# 
# ðŸ’¡ Be creative and try to define your own guidelines to test GoLLIE!
